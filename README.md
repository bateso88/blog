### This website

I am following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYv55DhgTuA) to build the bare bones of this website. Once I have a decent skeleton that I'm happy with, I will apply my own design, refactor to employ best practices and write comprehensive tests. Then I will expand the website in whichever direction I choose!


Differences I've made "live" while following tutorial. 
1. Typescript instead of js
2. File structure (services in different files, components in different folders)
3. Added es lint
4. ....

- Blog post exploring why? E.g. why is typescript better than js (useful for me to find out!)? Why did I structure files differently? Why es lint... why does order of imports matter?

- Blog post discovering learnings from building this. Tailwind feels like a lot of repitition - Could build a mini design system/start forming reusable components for e.g. text/images/types of divs, why is useRef useful?
